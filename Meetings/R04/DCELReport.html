					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Given two convex polyhedra in three-dimensional space, we 
develop an algorithm to (i) test whether their intersection is empty, 
and (ii) if so to find a separating plane, while (iii) if not to find a 
point in the intersection and explicitly construct their intersection 
polyhedron. The algorithm runs in timeO (n log n), where n is the sum of
 the numbers of vertices of the two polyhedra. The part of the algorithm
 concerned with (iii) (constructing the intersection) is based upon the 
fact that if a point in the intersection is known, then the entire 
intersection is obtained from the convex hull of suitable geometric 
duals of the two polyhedra taken with respect to this point.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Computational geometry emerged from the ?eld of algorithms 
design and analysis in the late 1970s. It has grown into a recognized 
discipline with its own journals, conferences, and a large community of 
active researchers. The success of the ?eld as a research discipline can
 on the one hand be explained from the beauty of the problems studied 
and the solutions obtained, and, on the other hand, by the many 
application domains—computer graphics, geographic information systems 
(GIS), robotics, and others—in which geometric algorithms play a 
fundamental role. For many geometric problems the early algorithmic 
solutions were either slow or dif?cult to understand and implement. In 
recent years a number of new algorithmic techniques have been developed 
that improved and simpli?ed many of the previous approaches. In this 
textbook we have tried to make these modern algorithmic solutions 
accessible to a large audience. The book has been written as a textbook 
for a course in computational geometry, but it can also be used for 
self-study.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>From the reviews: "This book offers a coherent treatment, at 
the graduate textbook level, of the field that has come to be known in 
the last decade or so as computational geometry. ... ... The book is 
well organized and lucidly written; a timely contribution by two 
founders of the field. It clearly demonstrates that computational 
geometry in the plane is now a fairly well-understood branch of computer
 science and mathematics. It also points the way to the solution of the 
more challenging problems in dimensions higher than two." #Mathematical 
Reviews#1 "... This remarkable book is a comprehensive and systematic 
study on research results obtained especially in the last ten years. The
 very clear presentation concentrates on basic ideas, fundamental 
combinatorial structures, and crucial algorithmic techniques. The plenty
 of results is clever organized following these guidelines and within 
the framework of some detailed case studies. A large number of figures 
and examples also aid the understanding of the material. Therefore, it 
can be highly recommended as an early graduate text but it should prove 
also to be essential to researchers and professionals in applied fields 
of computer-aided design, computer graphics, and robotics." #Biometrical

						<td>Finding the intersection, union, or difference of two simple 
polygons are well known problems in computational geometry. In this 
paper, new algorithms and their implementation solving these problems 
are presented. Assuming that line segment intersection is done already, 
the common main idea is to build up a colored doubly connected edge list
 (DCEL), independently of the actual operation. Colors indicate the 
relationship between polygons and elements, i.e. every element covered 
by a polygon will get its color. In order to perform the respective 
boolean operation the DCEL is traversed for elements with a certain 
color. It will be shown that the DCEL can be constructed in O(n log(n)) 
time and using this constructed DCEL the boolean operations need O(n) 
time. The given implementation, which is part of the Cgal  1  library, 
is parameterized with traits classes that define geometric predicates, 
number types, and representation classes. This approach makes it easy to
 adapt the algorithms to o...</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Constant-work-space algorithms may use only constantly many 
cells of storage in addition to their input, which is provided as a 
read-only array. We show how to construct several geometric structures 
efficiently in the constant-work-space model. Traditional algorithms 
process the input into a suitable data structure (like a 
doubly-connected edge list) that allows efficient traversal of the 
structure at hand. In the constant-work-space setting, however, we 
cannot afford to do this. Instead, we provide operations that compute 
the desired features on the fly by accessing the input with no extra 
space. The whole geometric structure can be obtained by using these 
operations to enumerate all the features. Of course, we must pay for the
 space savings by slower running times. While the standard data 
structure allows us to implement traversal operations in constant time, 
our schemes typically take linear time to read the input data in each 
step. We begin with two simple problems: triangulating a planar point 
set and finding the trapezoidal decomposition of a simple polygon. In 
both cases adjacent features can be enumerated in linear time per step, 
resulting in total quadratic running time to output the whole structure.
 Actually, we show that the former result carries over to the Delaunay 
triangulation, and hence the Voronoi diagram. This also means that we 
can compute the largest empty circle of a planar point set in quadratic 
time and constant work-space. As another application, we demonstrate how
 to enumerate the features of an Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) 
in quadratic time per step, so that the whole EMST can be found in cubic
 time using constant work-space. Finally, we describe how to compute a 
shortest geodesic path between two points in a simple polygon. Although 
the shortest path problem in general graphs is NL-complete [18], this 
constrained problem can be solved in quadratic time using only constant 
work-space.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Parallelizing data mining algorithms has become a necessity as
 we try to mine ever increasing volumes of data. Spatial data mining 
algorithms like Dbscan, Optics, Slink, etc. have been parallelized to 
exploit a cluster infrastructure. The efficiency achieved by existing 
algorithms can be attributed to spatial locality preservation using 
spatial indexing structures like k-d-tree, quad-tree, grid files, etc. 
for distributing data among cluster nodes. However, these indexing 
structures are static in nature, i.e., they need to scan the entire 
dataset to determine the partitioning coordinates. This results in high 
data distribution cost when the data size is large. In this paper, we 
propose a dynamic distributed data structure, DD-Rtree, which preserves 
spatial locality while distributing data across compute nodes in a 
shared nothing environment. Moreover, DD-Rtree is dynamic, i.e., it can

compare the quality of data distribution achieved by DD-Rtree with one 
of the recent distributed indexing structure, SD-Rtree. We also compare 
the efficiency of queries supported by these indexing structures along 
with the overall efficiency of DBSCAN algorithm. Our experimental 
results show that DD-Rtree achieves better data distribution and thereby
 resulting in improved overall efficiency.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper describes data structures and algorithms for 
efficient implementation of GIS operations for large datasets on 
multicore Intel CPUs and on NVIDA GPUs. Typical operations are boolean 
combinations of polygons and map overlay. Efficient parallelization 
prefers simple regular data structures, such as structures of arrays of 
plain old datatypes. Warps of 32 threads are required to execute the 
same instruction (or be idle). Ideally, the data used by adjacent 
threads is adjacent in memory. Minimizing storage is important, as is 
accessing it in a regular pattern. That disparages pointers, linked 
lists, and trees. That implies that explicitly representing global 
topology is bad. If using only local topological formulae is sufficient,
 then it will be much faster. E.g., for many operations on a 2-D map 
(aka planar graph), the set of oriented edges suffices. Each edge knows 
the locations of its endpoints and the ids of its adjacent polygons. Any
 mass operation, such as area computation or point location, can be 
implemented as a map-reduce. All these techniques also apply in 3D to 
CAD/CAM and additive manufacturing. Indeed they are more important 
there.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>We present EPUG-Overlay (Exact Parallel Uniform Grid Overlay),
 an algorithm to overlay two maps that is fast and parallel, has no 
roundoﬀ errors, and is freely available. EPUG-Overlay combines several 
novel aspects. It represents coordinates with rational numbers, thereby 
ensuring exact computations with no roundoﬀ errors and the ensuing 
sliver problems and topological impossibilities. For eﬃciency, 
EPUG-Overlay performs the map overlay in parallel, thereby utilizing the
 ubiquitous multicore architecture. Our application goes beyond merely 
using existing packages, which are ineﬃcient when used in parallel on 
large problems. Indeed, overlaying two maps with 53,000,000 edges and 
730,000 faces took only 322 elapsed seconds (plus 116 seconds for I/O) 
on a dual 8-core 3.1 GHz Intel Xeon E5-2687 workstation. In contrast, 
GRASS, executing sequentially and generating roundoﬀ errors, takes 5300 
seconds.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>This paper provides the first attempt for a full-fledged query
 optimizer for MapReduce-based spatial join algorithms. The optimizer 
develops its own taxonomy that covers almost all possible ways of doing a
 spatial join for any two input datasets. The optimizer comes in two 
flavors; cost-based and rule-based. Given two input data sets, the 
cost-based query optimizer evaluates the costs of all possible options 
in the developed taxonomy, and selects the one with the lowest cost. The
 rule-based query optimizer abstracts the developed cost models of the 
cost-based optimizer into a set of simple easy-tocheck heuristic rules. 
Then, it applies its rules to select the lowest cost option. Both query 
optimizers are deployed and experimentally evaluated inside a widely 
used open-source MapReduce-based big spatial data system. Exhaustive 
experiments show that both query optimizers are always successful in 
taking the right decision for spatially joining any two datasets of up 
to 500GB each.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Polygon intersection is an important spatial data-handling 
process, on which many spatial operations are based. However, this 
process is computationally intensive because it involves the detection 
and calculation of polygon intersections. We addressed this computation 
issue based on two perspectives. First, we improved a method called 
boundary algebra ﬁlling to eﬃciently rasterize the input polygons. 
Polygon intersections were subsequently detected in the cells of the 
raster. Owing to the use of a raster data structure, this method oﬀers 
advantages of reduced task dependence and improved performance. Based on
 this method, we developed parallel strategies for diﬀerent procedures 
in terms of workload decomposition and task scheduling. Thus, the 
workload across diﬀerent parallel processes can be balanced. The results
 suggest that our method can eﬀectively accelerate the process of 
polygon intersection. When addressing datasets with 1,409,020 groups of 
overlapping polygons, our method could reduce the total execution time 
from 987.82 to 53.66 s, thereby obtaining an optimal speedup ratio of 
18.41 while consistently balancing the workloads. We also tested the 
eﬀect of task scheduling on the parallel eﬃciency, showing that reducing
 the total runtime is eﬀective, especially for a lower number of 
processes. Finally, the good scalability of the method is demonstrated.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Polygon overlay is one of the complex operations in Geographic
 Information Systems (GIS). In GIS, a typical polygon tends to be large 
in size often consisting of thousands of vertices. Sequential algorithms
 for this problem are in abundance in literature and most of the 
parallel algorithms concentrate on parallelizing edge intersection phase
 only. Our research aims to develop parallel algorithms to find overlay 
for two input polygons which can be extended to handle multiple polygons
 and implement it on General Purpose Graphics Processing Units (GPGPU) 
which offers massive parallelism at relatively low cost. Moreover, 
spatial data files tend to be large in size (in GBs) and the underlying 
overlay computation is highly irregular and compute intensive. MapReduce
 paradigm is now standard in industry and academia for processing 
large-scale data. Motivated by MapReduce programming model, we propose 
to develop and implement scalable distributed algorithms to solve 
large-scale overlay processing in this dissertation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>In pursuit of graph processing performance, the systems 
community has largely abandoned general-purpose distributed dataﬂow 
frameworks in favor of specialized graph processing systems that provide
 tailored programming abstractions and accelerate the execution of 
iterative graph algorithms. In this paper we argue that many of the 
advantages of specialized graph processing systems can be recovered in a
 modern general-purpose distributed dataﬂow system. We introduce GraphX,
 an embedded graph processing framework built on top of Apache Spark, a 
widely used distributed dataﬂow system. GraphX presents a familiar 
composable graph abstraction that is sufﬁcient to express existing graph
 APIs, yet can be implemented using only a few basic dataﬂow operators 
(e.g., join, map, group-by). To achieve performance parity with 
specialized graph systems, GraphX recasts graph-speciﬁc optimizations as
 distributed join optimizations and materialized view maintenance. By 
leveraging advances in distributed dataﬂow frameworks, GraphX brings 
low-cost fault tolerance to graph processing. We evaluate GraphX on real
 workloads and demonstrate that GraphX achieves an order of magnitude 
performance gain over the base dataﬂow framework and matches the 
performance of specialized graph processing systems while enabling a 
wider range of computation.</td>

					<th>Abstract</th>
						<td>Interest in incremental and adaptive query processing has led 
to the investigation of equijoin evaluation algorithms that are 
non-blocking. This investigation has yielded a number of algorithms, 
including the symmetric hash join, the XJoin, the Ripple Join, and their
 variants. However, to our knowledge no one has proposed a nonblocking 
spatial join algorithm. In this paper, we propose a parallel 
non-blocking spatial join algorithm that uses duplicate avoidance rather
 than duplicate elimination. Results from a prototype implementation in a
 commercial parallel object-relational DBMS show that it generates 
answer tuples steadily even in the presence of memory overflow, and that
 its rate of producing answer tuples scales with the number of 
processors. Also, when allowed to run to completion, its performance is 
comparable with the state-of-the-art blocking parallel spatial join 
algorithm.</td>
